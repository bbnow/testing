{"name":"Surf","tagline":"IoT/M2M for Amazon AWS","body":"### Description\r\n_Surf_ is an open source framework for connecting various data collection technologies (messaging, logging, applications, etc.) to _Amazon Kinesis_.\r\n\r\n![Surf Picture](images/surf2_4.jpg)\r\n\r\n_Surf_ can be used as a server connecting several devices at once. Or it can be used as a library, providing an abstracted view of _Kinesis_ API.\r\nSurf has a small run-time footprint and is easily extensible. We intend on keeping it up-to-date with emerging user requirements and active projects.  \r\n\r\n### Why Open Source IoT/M2M with AWS?\r\nInnovation in IoT/M2M space comes from two areas – _devices_ and _applications_. The connectivity fabric, operations, scaling, application integration and other platform capabilities are critical for a functioning system, but not differentiating.\r\n\r\nToday such platform capabilities are commonly provided either by Telecoms or by purpose-built products. In either case, the platforms severely limit developer’s abilities to experiment, leverage open-source community, and scale-as-you-go.\r\n\r\nWe believe that the combination of open-source frameworks and operational simplicity of AWS provides a powerful alternative to proprietary IoT/M2M platforms.\r\n\r\n![AWS Picture](images/surf3_4.jpg)\r\n\r\n_Surf_ is our initial step towards open source IoT/M2M frameworks.  \r\n\r\n### Capabilities\r\n\r\nFile tailer, HTTP, SDK\r\n\r\n### Example\r\n\r\nTBD","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
